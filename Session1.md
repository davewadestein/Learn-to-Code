# Summary of Session 1: A lot of terminology
 * bit = "binary digit" = a 0 or 1
   * this is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process/store
 * byte = 8 bits = 1 character (on a US keyboard)
 * CPU = Central Processing Unit = "brain" of a computer
   * it's a _super_ fast, _super_ dumb brain
   * it can do billions of operations per second
   * ...but each operation is pretty simple
     * moving data from memory into the CPU
     * storing data in the CPU into memory
     * integer arithmetic (e.g., 2 + 3)
     * floating point arithmetic (e.g., 2.3 * -5.1)
     * branching ("jump" to a different place in the code)
  
 * to be continued
